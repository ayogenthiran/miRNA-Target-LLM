# miRNA-Target-LLM

## About the Project

This project demonstrates the pre-training and fine-tuning of a large language model (LLM) to predict interactions between miRNA sequences and protein targets.

### Data

**Dataset Index**

- **miRTarBase**: This dataset contains experimentally validated miRNA-target interactions, which were obtained by manually surveying pertinent literature.
- **Task**: Binary classification, where the model predicts the interaction between miRNA and protein targets.
